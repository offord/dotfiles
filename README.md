# dotfiles
Linux dot files

This is just a repository for simple dot files I have developed on my Raspberry PI Model 2.

Examples include:

* .bashrc
* .bash_aliases
* .bash_functions
* .profile

They exist as undotted files and are renamed when pushed to your ~/bin directory using the publish script.
